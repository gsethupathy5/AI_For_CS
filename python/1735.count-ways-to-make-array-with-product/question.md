# [1735. Count Ways to Make Array With Product][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-make-array-with-product/

You are given a 2D integer array, `queries`. For each `queries[i]`, where `queries[i] = [nᵢ, kᵢ]`,
find the number of different ways you can place positive integers into an array of size `nᵢ` such
that the product of the integers is `kᵢ`. As the number of ways may be too large, the answer to the
`iᵗʰ` query is the number of ways **modulo** `10⁹ + 7`.

Return an integer array  `answer` where  `answer.length == queries.length`, and  `answer[i]` is the
answer to the  `iᵗʰ` query.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: queries = [[2,6],[5,1],[73,660]]
Output: [4,1,50734910]
Explanation: Each query is independent.
[2,6]: There are 4 ways to fill an array of size 2 that multiply to 6: [1,6], [2,3], [3,2], [6,1].
[5,1]: There is 1 way to fill an array of size 5 that multiply to 1: [1,1,1,1,1].
[73,660]: There are 1050734917 ways to fill an array of size 73 that multiply to 660. 1050734917
modulo 10⁹ + 7 = 50734910.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: queries = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: [1,2,3,10,5]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= queries.length <= 10⁴ `
- `1 <= nᵢ, kᵢ <= 10⁴`
