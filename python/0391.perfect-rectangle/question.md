# [391. Perfect Rectangle][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-rectangle/

Given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [xᵢ, yᵢ, aᵢ, bᵢ]` represents an axis-aligned
rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is `(xᵢ, yᵢ)` and the top-right point of it is `(aᵢ,
bᵢ)`.

Return `true`if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4],[1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,2,3],[1,3,2,4],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[2,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `rectangles[i].length == 4`
- `-10⁵ <= xᵢ, yᵢ, aᵢ, bᵢ <= 10⁵`
