input:
[1,3]
6
output:
1Explanation:Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].So we only need 1 patch.
