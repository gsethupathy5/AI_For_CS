# [779. K-th Symbol in Grammar][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/

We build a table of `n` rows ( **1-indexed**). We start by writing `0` in the `1ˢᵗ` row. Now in every
subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each
occurrence of `1` with `10`.

- For example, for `n = 3`, the `1ˢᵗ` row is `0`, the `2ⁿᵈ` row is `01`, and the `3ʳᵈ` row is `0110`.

Given two integer `n` and `k`, return the `kᵗʰ` ( **1-indexed**) symbol in the `nᵗʰ` row of a table
of `n` rows.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: row 1: 0
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation:
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 30`
- `1 <= k <= 2ⁿ ⁻ ¹`
